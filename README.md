# ThreeJS
A repository exploring Three.js and various shapes, lights and textures. Some use a solids intersetion library and a simplex noise library.
Also, a 2D Canvas animation exploring CSS 3D transformations in 2D.
Simply open the html files to view. Some files can change perspective by dragging across the screen to change the camera view.
